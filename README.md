Audible Notification: Plays a beep sound at the end of the timer.
User-Friendly Interface: Clear and polite messages for a seamless experience.

Accurate Time Delay:

Problem: Maintaining a consistent delay between updates.
Solution: Used time.sleep(1) for precise 1-second intervals.
End-of-Timer Notification:

Problem: Informing the user effectively when the timer ends.
Solution: Integrated winsound.Beep() for an audible alert.
Input Handling:

Problem: Ensuring the user enters valid input.
Solution: Used int(input()) to convert the input to an integer.
